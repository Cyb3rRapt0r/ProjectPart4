# Videogame Congregate Website
Project Part 4 for Intro to Web Development (IS-117-005)

Tasked to create a website with at least five pages on a subject of my choosing. I chose to focus 
on news, reviews and video coverage on the latest videogame releases. The idea was to make an 
all-in-one news source on the visitor's favorite videogames. It was designed in four parts:
•Part 1: Define the goals, the audience, page topics, and a call to action.
•Part 2: Develop the site map.
•Part 3: Wireframe the critical pages.
•Part 4: Develop the actual pages.
Under these guidelines, I was able to use Bootstrap code to create responsive design and 
navigation that makes it compatible with desktop and mobile screens.
